# Polynomial Fractal Visualisation
C# (polynomials solving in c++ native code) program with GUI to visualize roots of polynomials with constrained coefficients.

Inspired by this youtube video by 2swap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HIy5dJE-zQ&t=3s

## Features
* Any order of polynomial
* Any number of coefficients contraints
* Draggable and zoomable surface
* Draggable coefficients
* Configurable with right click context menu
* Native code optimized solver (CPU)
* OpenGL rendering
